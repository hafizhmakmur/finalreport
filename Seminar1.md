# Latar Belakang
* Males ngurusin bug? -> Metode Formal!
* Bingung pake metode formal? -> Liquid Haskell!
* Gtw Liquid Haskell bagus apa ga? -> Tes RBT!
* RBT yang mana? -> RBT Might!

# RBT
* Binary Tree
Here is a very unbalanced binary tree 1<-2->3->4->...
* RBT
Here is an as unbalanced as possible RBT but still not that unbalanced. 
Show invariants.
* Okasaki
Can be shown as trivial? 
* Might
Hmmmmm
* Previous Work
Okasaki has been proven all over even with Liquid. 
Might has been proven with QuickCheck and GADT

# Liquid Haskell
* Haskell
show normal type signature
* LH
show precond and postcond as type. {variable:type | condition}

# Verification Method
* Source code
Link github
* Specification source
Error ~Exception~, invariant, half invariants, measure, obvious specs.
